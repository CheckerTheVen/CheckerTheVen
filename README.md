## Biography

My name is Can Cekic. *Checker* is an alias originating from my first IT teacher, who was not able to pronounce my name and it's based on child's show moderator *CheckerCan*.

I am 24 years old, born 2000 in Germany and still living here. I am an aspiring programmer that works with a wide variety of frameworks and languages.

## Experience

I first came in contact with the programming in 2016 when I went to the [Gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(Germany)) in order to obtain the ability to attend to university. I was taught the basics of object-oriented programming by the use of Java for the three years that were to follow.
