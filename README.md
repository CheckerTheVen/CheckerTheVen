## ðŸ“– Biography

My name is Can Cekic. *Checker* is an alias originating from my first IT teacher, who was not able to pronounce my name and it's based on German child's show moderator *CheckerCan*.

I am 24 years old, born 2000 in Germany and still living here. I am an aspiring programmer that works with a wide variety of frameworks and languages.

## ðŸ’¡ Experiences

I first came in contact with the programming in 2016 when I went to the [Gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(Germany) "Wikipedia article: German Gymnasium") in order to obtain the ability to attend to university. I was taught the basics of object-oriented programming by the use of Java for the three years that were to follow. I graduated successfully with a good performance in the IT-focused field.

In 2020, my attempts to attend to university failed after two semesters, but took this setback as the opportunity to start an [apprenticeship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship_in_Germany "Wikipedia article: German apprenticeships") at a local company, starting in 2022. They specialized in the development of software for public service institutes, which gave me valuable insights in the active development of software projects in productive environments. After two and a half years, I completed this step by passing all necessary exams throughout my apprenticeship, leaving me offically as a software developer.

Over the years until this day, I spend a lot of my free time programming or working on other computer-related topics as a form self-development, but mainly just because I am very interested in programming itself. Having the ability to tell a computer how to act and what to do is a powerful strength to have, and one that I am more than willing to become better at and willing to use.
