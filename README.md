# ✨ Welcome to my profile! ✨



## Biography

My name is Can Cekic. *Checker* is an alias originating from my first IT teacher, who was not able to pronounce my name and it's based on child's show moderator *CheckerCan*.

I am 24 years old, born 2000 in Germany and still living here. I am an aspiring programmer that works with a wide variety of frameworks and languages.

## Experience

I first came in contact with the programming in 2016 when I went to the [Gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(Germany)) in order to obtain the ability to attend to university. I was taught the basics of object-oriented programming by the use of Java for the three years that were to follow. I graduated successfully with a good performance in the IT-focused field.

In 2020, my attempts to attend to university failed after two semesters, but took this setback as the opportunity to start an [apprenticeship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship_in_Germany) at a  local company that is specialized in the development of software for public service institutes, which gave me valuable insights in the active development of software projects in productive environments.
