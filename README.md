# âœ¨ Welcome to my profile! âœ¨

### My name is Can Cekic. I am 24 years old, born in 2000 in Germany, and an aspiring programmer!

And this is my little space where I share my software projects and workbench codes in, or where I sometimes work on things with friends.

> ðŸ“‘ **Sidenote:** *"Checker" is an alias originating from my first IT teacher, who was not able to pronounce my name and it's based on German child's show moderator "CheckerCan"*.

## How things started...

My interest in programming started when I first came in contact with it as I went on a [Gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(Germany) "Wikipedia article: German Gymnasium") back in 2016.

With an [apprenticeship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship_in_Germany "Wikipedia article: German apprenticeships") I started in 2022, I gained valuable insights in the active development of software projects in productive environments for the two and half years of my apprenticeship's duration.

Over the years until this day, I spend a lot of my free time programming as a form self-development, but mainly just because I am very interested in coding itself. ðŸ˜Š

## Other stuff I do

Besides programming, activities that dominantly take up my time is drawing and bicycling. Also, I play Volleyball, play video games, have movie or board game nights with friends, create MS Word templates, build LEGO sets.
